Once that is done when Ecplise is restarted click open Existing file or File -> open File
Navigate to Location of Zip -> PS1 Waheed Sharifi -> CS172 PS1 -> PS1.py
This will open up the file, then to run it click the drop down arrow on the green play button on the top row. Then click run "1 PS1 Waheed Sharifi" It will run the program.

Or on the top Menu Bar click Run -> Run Configurations -> finish
This will also run it.

If the input is not in quotations or if it has anything other than a letter in between quotes it will not work and will need to be rerun.
